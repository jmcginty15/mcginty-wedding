          Holy Matrimony is a sacrament of the Orthodox Church in which a man
          and a woman agree before Christ, the priest, and the Church to be
          loyally united together for life. Christ blesses their marriage
          through their sacramental union in the Church. God's grace is imparted
          through this ceremony to help the couple live together in His love,
          mutually fulfilling and perfecting each other. A sacrament is a
          mystery in which the heavenly and earthly realms are brought together
          by the Holy Spirit. We are joined in Holy Matrimony with Christ, as He
          is the Bridegroom and the Church is His Bride.

          A Description of an Orthodox Christian Wedding
        </h3>
        <p>
          In preparing for an Orthodox wedding, it will be helpful to understand
          the unique aspects of an Orthodox Christian wedding. The ceremony is
          rich in tradition and symbolism. Orthodox Christians believe that it
          is God who unites the couple; in the sacrament of marriage, the Church
          recognizes and blesses the union God has begun in their lives. Without
          this sacrament, the marriage will suffer pain, sin, and death. Through
          their union with Christ, the couple has the hope of a new life
          together as one flesh in God's Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sacrament of Marriage is actually two services in one: first, the
          Betrothal service and then the Wedding or Crowning service.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">The Betrothal Service</h3>
        <p>
          The couple's entrance into the church from the narthex, the area
          closest to the outside world, represents that the relationship which
          began "in this world" will now move into the church for blessing to
          enter "the world to come." At this time the bride and groom each
          declare their willingness to be married to the other. This part of the
          service recognizes the civil union through which a man and a woman
          come with free will to join each other. And yet, it is much more than
          a legal contract. In fact, in the Orthodox service the couple do not
          exchange vows. They have come to the Church to recognize God's union
          in their relationship, not merely to make promises to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The priest then gives the bride and groom candles that they will carry
          throughout the rest of the service as a sign of their willingness to
          follow Christ and His light. They are acknowledging their desire to
          have their lives lighted by the teachings of Christ and His Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Betrothal, the priest prays for the couple to have a life
          of perfect love together, for salvation, and for the blessing of
          children from their union. The priest first blesses the rings and then
          lifts them above the heads of the bride and groom as he blesses their
          betrothal three times, in the name of the "Father, and the Son, and
          the Holy Spirit," invoking the mystical presence of the Holy Trinity.
          The rings are then exchanged and placed on the ring finger of the
          right hand of the man and the woman. (Promises are made and oaths are
          taken with the right hand, symbolizing the right hand of God that
          blesses. Christ ascended to sit at the right hand of the Father.
          Finally, those who inherit eternal life will go to the right hand of
          God.) In some Orthodox traditions, the bride and groom exchange the
          rings to symbolize that they will compensate for each other's
          strengths and weaknesses. Only by the union of the two are they made
          perfect.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">
          The Beginning of the Wedding Service
        </h3>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the Wedding Service, the priest censes around the
          table before the altar as he chants Psalm 128, "Blessed are they that
          fear the Lord, and walk in His ways..." By coming to the altar, the
          couple offer their lives together to God for His blessing.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">The Joining of the Right Hands</h3>
        <p>
          While offering prayers to "join" the bride and groom to "unite them in
          one mind and one flesh," the priest joins their right hands to
          symbolize their union. The couple holds hands for the rest of the
          service.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">The Crowning</h3>
        <p>
          The priest offers prayers for the couple and then blesses the crowns,
          which are placed on their heads. The crowns symbolize the glory and
          honor with which God crowns the bride and groom. The crowns have two
          meanings: First, the couple have come into the Kingdom of God and
          taken their place as a king and queen in their marital kingdom.
          Secondly, the crowns represent martyrdom. The word "martyr" means
          "witness." The couple bears witness to Christ's presence in their
          lives, which requires both to die to themselves and to give of their
          lives for the other. The ribbon joining the crowns represents the
          unity of the couple. The crowns are exchanged three times to signify
          the sealing of the complete union. Many Orthodox couples keep the
          crowns to remind them of the crowns of glory that will be awarded to
          them in eternal life if they guard their virtue in their marriage.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">Scripture Readings</h3>
        <p>
          The Epistle reading, Ephesians 5:20-33, explains the mystery and
          holiness of marriage, as well as the duties and responsibilities of a
          husband and wife. The love of the couple parallels the love of Christ
          and His Church. The couple becomes one in their submission to each
          other and to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gospel reading, St John 2:1-11, retells the story of the wedding
          at Cana, where Christ blessed marriage by turning the water into wine,
          symbolizing the turning of our passions into virtues.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">The Common Cup</h3>
        <p>
          Although this is not the Holy Eucharist, the bride and groom drink
          from a common cup to signify the sharing of their lives togetherâ€”their
          joys <i>and</i> their sorrows.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">The Dance of Isaiah</h3>
        <p>
          The Dance of Isaiah is a procession led by the priest as he places his
          hands on the joined hands of the bride and groom. They process three
          times around a table on which the cross and the Gospel book are
          placed, as a reminder that they must keep Christ at the center of the
          marriage. The hymns sung during the Dance of Isaiah recall the themes
          of blessing, martyrdom, and the setting apart of the couple from this
          world to a union with Christ. The best man and maid of honor follow
          the bride and groom as witnesses, and pledge lifelong moral and
          spiritual support.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">
          The Removal of the Crowns and the Blessing of the Couple
        </h3>
        <p>
          The priest removes the crowns and places them on the Gospel book as an
          offering of the marriage to the Lord. The priest prays that God will
          receive these crowns into His Kingdom. The couple now begin their
          journey together in Christ at the foot of His altar. They are an icon
          of Christ and His Church to the witnesses attending this sacrament of
          their threefold union.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will notice that nowhere in the wedding service is the phrase
          "until death do us part." Marriage is an eternal relationship that
          begins in this world and is perfected in God's Kingdom. In Christ,
          marriage is restored to its original perfection through the sacrament
          and becomes an eternal life of joy in union with Him. Christ destroyed
          death by His Cross and Resurrection; therefore, death has no power to
          separate the marriage.
        </p>
        <h3 className="Info-subtitle-body">The Wedding Favors</h3>
        <p>
          The sugar-coated almonds offered to guests symbolize the honey-dipped
          almonds given by priests in the ancient Church. The white coating
          symbolizes purity; the egg shape represents fertility and new life
          that begins in marriage. The hardness of the almond represents the
          endurance of marriage, and the sweetness of the sugar encourages the
          hope of the sweetness of future life together. Giving of three almonds
          signifies the union is indivisible, just as the bride and groom will
          remain undivided in their union with each other and with Christ.
